Description:
Cub3d is a graphical project for 42 school to further knowledge about graphical work, more specifically, 3d through raycasting.
It simulates a technical version of wolfenstein therefore the name (wolf -> cub).

Instructions:
MinilibX, the graphical engine used, uses a few libraries that might not be available in your machine. You can install them by running the following command if needed:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev

You can compile the program by running "make" in the project's root folder and to run it just type "./bin/cub3d *mapname.cub*" or "bash bin/cub3d *mapname.cub*".
